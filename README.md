## Overview

Serverless/FaaS computing really started taking off with the launch of AWS Lamba.  However, the downside of a vendor-specific solution like AWS Lambda is vendor lock-in - you can no longer easily move your application to another provider and you have no control over your cost. Recently Red Hat and other companies have made a bet on Apache OpenWhisk, an Open Source solution for serverless computing that will run across all cloud and on-premise environments, and which as an Open Source solution can be implemented by multiple vendors or by users themselves.

## 1.   Vision and Goals Of The Project:

The goal of this project is to build an on demand "supercomputer" out of OpenWhisk on OpenShift on OpenStack in the MOC.  Namely, we will take a highly parallelizable function, the computation of pi, and rather than spin up virtual machines or containers to solve the problem, we can instead use OpenWhisk/FaaS to have an on demand supercomputer.  The goal would be to give a small portion of the work to each function, and spin up 1000s of workers to accomplish the job as quickly as possible. We will build a script to act as an orchestrator and coordinate these workers. 


## 2. Users/Personas Of The Project:

There is not a particular end user who will be using this. Rather, this will serve as a proof of concept that OpenWhisk and OpenShift can be used to solve a parallel algorithm. By providing performance metrics, we will be able to show whether or not using FaaS on OpenStack is a viable and cost effective approach for develoment. If successful, an approach like the one we are taking may be used in the future by individual/institution looking for a solution of large scale distributed algorithm as fast and cheaply as possible.

## 3.   Scope and Features Of The Project:
  * An orchestrator that is capable of distributing a parallelizable function on OpenWhisk on OpenShift environment at low cost and as fast as possible
  
  * The orchestrator should be extendable to create an on demand supercomputer for parallelizable tasks on OpenWhisk on OpenShift in the MoC.
  
  * Ability to move to different vendors

## 4. Solution Concept

##### Global Architectural Structure Of the Project:
![](https://github.com/BU-NU-CLOUD-SP18/Serverless-Supercomputing/blob/master/images/SystemArchitecture.png)

##### The system (blue in the diagram above) will be involved in the following steps:
1. The system will divide a highly parallelizable algorithm (tbd) into subparts that can be run concurrently. Each unique subpart will be registered as an action on OpenWhisk.
2. The system will issue POST requests to OpenWhisk to trigger the actions with specified parameters.
3. For each action that is invoked, OpenWhisk will spawn a Docker container, and then the action code gets injected and executed using the parameters passed to it. OpenWhisk will respond the the POST requests with a unique process id for the action that was triggered by each specific request. 
4. When the action is finished executing in the Docker container, the container will be torn down. The result of the action will be stored in the DB on OpenWhisk under the unique process id for that action.
5. The system will issue another set of requests to OpenWhisk to get the results of the actions that were triggered. Each request will contain the process id of the action whose result is desired.
6. Using all results from the parallelized actions, the system will construct the result for the initial algorithm that was being run.

## 5. Acceptance criteria

- The system must be able to parallelize an algorithm to compute pi and run on OpenWhisk on OpenShift
- We must provide performance tests to validate the improved performance at scale
- The system must be deployable on the MOC
- We must provide performance tests for the sytem running on the MOC
- The algorithm should scale linearly as more machines are added
- The the algorithm should run in 30 seconds or less

## Steps to run orchestrator.js
### Prerequisite
* Docker should be installed
* OpenShift cli for oc commands
* OpenWhisk cli setup and wsk binaries path set in $PATH
* (if running on a VM Node.js should be installed on the machine)

### Commands
* systemctl start docker
* sudo ip link set docker0 promisc on
* systemctl restart docker
* sudo oc cluster up
* sudo oc new-project openwhisk
* sudo oc process -f ./template.yml |sudo  oc create -f -

* sudo oc logs -f $(sudo oc get pods | grep controller | awk '{print $1}') | grep "invoker status changed"
(wait till invoker status changed is healthy)

* AUTH_SECRET=$(sudo oc get secret whisk.auth -o yaml | grep "system:" | awk '{print $2}' | base64 --decode) &&
/home/fedora/binaries/wsk property set --auth $AUTH_SECRET --apihost $(sudo oc get route/openwhisk --template={{.spec.host}})

* node orchestrator.js
